Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input,
we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern take out the responsibility of instantiation of a class from client program to the factory class.
We can apply Singleton pattern on Factory class or make the factory method static. 
This is one of the most widely used java design pattern.

Super class in factory design pattern can be an interface, abstract class or a normal java class.
